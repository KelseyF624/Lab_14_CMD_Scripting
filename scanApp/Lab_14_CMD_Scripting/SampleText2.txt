I have 3 cats. Tenderloin, Glenn and Carl. 

Tenderloin = 2 years old, tabby. I found him at my local fair living under and AC unit behind a tenderloin booth. The booth helped my friends and I catch him. Hence the name.
Carl = less than 1 year, orange kitty. Named after the walking dead character because him and his siblings were saved from a hoarding situation and many of his siblings died and he wasn't expected to live. So, him and his brother are the walking dead.
Glenn = less than 1 year, black kitty with white flecking (salt and pepper). Same backstory as Carl. :)
